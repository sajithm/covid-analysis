## Introduction

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Coronavirus, biologically known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of Chinaâ€™s Hubei province in December 2019 and has spread all over the world since then. 

We attempt to look at its spread in Bangalore and attempt to determine if demographic factors like age and gender play a role in this infection. We also attempt to analyse the effect of ambient temperature on the spread of this infection.

## Questions
1. Is there any relationship between gender and being infected?
2. Is there any relationship between gender and death from infection?
3. Is there any relationship between age and being infected?
4. Is there any relationship between age and death from infection?
5. Is there any relationship between number of infections and temperature?
